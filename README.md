# README
[Merchant](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/merchant.html)

Unfortunately, the guide is out of date at this point, but I went through every iteration.

This is a small project for a small online store.
The default CSS style from the tutorial is used.

- The creation of new products with the product image
- display in the list of products, 
- the product card, 
- the list of orders, 
- the order card, ability to change items quantity in the order, total sum
- the function of check of the remains of a product are developed.
- Implemented the twitter-omniauth for User authentication
- Added `address` table to choose an order`s delivery address, select in the order page

Basically, everything is working now, the deprecated methods have been updated.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome!

But there are two problems: 
- 1) When I make an attempt to `submit` the order  - the order is deleted, 
- 2) accordingly, the redirection to the `confirmation` page does not work. I would be grateful for a hint in solving these problems.
Feel free to check the [issues page](https://github.com/Laguna1/merchant/issues).
